    "### Introduction\n",
    "Learn what a test is and how to run the first one of your own with the pytest library! You will get used to the pytest testing framework and the command-line interface. You will also learn how to process specific contexts, like \"failed tests\" and \"skipping the test\" with pytest markers.\n",

    "**Common problems:**\n",
    "* Bugs and errors\n",
    "* Hardware failures\n",
    "* Unexpected or unpredictable behavior\n",

    "* Identify defects, bugs, and errors\n",

    "**What is testing?**\n",

    "* Advanced Python programming\n",
    "* `assert` statements\n",
    "* Decorators\n",
